underscores.sass
================

An addon for underscores.me implementing easily transportable grunt.js with optional implementations of bourbon.neat and font-awesome!


Why was this created?
================

I like SASS and Grunt.js! I also LURVE underscores.me, which is unfortunately css only, so I wanted a portable implementation that would allow me to jump in and immediately use sass without having to modify underscores.me at all.

It should be pointed out that you don't have to use bourbon.neat or font-awesome. However, they are there if you like them. In main.scss, just comment out whatever libs you don't want to use.


So how to I use this?
================

First off, you need to have node.js, grunt.js, ruby, and sass installed (this all sounds a lot harder than it actually is).

Next, just dump these contents into your theme folder and start grunt from your theme folder.

Profit???


Why is this readme so sparce?
